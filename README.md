# Lab 13: Pizza Planet - Part 1
## Due: Tuesday, September 27th, 09:00
##### Depot/U 
###### Full Stack: Fall 2016

## Info
* You will be building a front-end and back-end for a space-themed pizza restaurant and arcade called Pizza Planet
* Your boss, The Claw, has chosen you
* You will be building a simple web page that shows a list of pizza planet locations
* The page will also have input boxes and a submit button for creating a new location

## Getting Started
* This is a NodeJS project, so we need a package.json file. Use `npm init` to create one
* Make sure you have a `.gitignore` file set to ignore the `node_modules` folder
* You will need to install the `express`, `body-parser`, and `mongodb` node modules. Make sure you use `--save`.

## Objectives - Database
* Data will be stored in a local MongoDB database named `pizzaPlanet`
* Locations will be stored in a collection called `locations`
* A pizza planet location needs to have the following information:
    * name (i.e. "5 Points South")
    * delivers (true/false)
    * phone
    * address (an address consists of line1, line2, city, state, zip)

## Objectives - API
* Build an express server
* Should statically serve the `client` folder
* Should respond to requests on the collection URL for getting all locations, and creating a new location
    * The collection URL should be `/api/locations`

## Objectives - Frontend
* Have an index.html in your client folder
* It should request all the locations from the API when it first loads
* You can style the locations on screen however you'd like
* You may use Bootstrap if you wish
* Each location should show the name, whether or not it delivers, the phone number, and the complete address
* There should be a set of input fields at the top of the page for creating a new location
    * Text box for location name
    * Checkbox for delivers
    * Tel box for phone
    * Series of text and number boxes for all address fields, with maxlength="2" for state and 5 for zip

## Coming Up
* Don't worry about making detail pages like you're having to do for P1
    * We will come back and do that when we learn Angular (makes it much easier)
* If you want a head start, you can make the API endpoints for the detail URL for a single location
    * Should support reading one, updating one, and deleting one location
